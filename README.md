## In this project I made multiple changes to the HTML and CSS. I removed classes and replaced them witht he appropriate HTML tag by following the HTML Semantics flow chart. I removed div tags and used HTML semantics to classify each section of my web page.Changes made are as followed:

# HTML changes:

By removing div tags in HTML and applying new tags using HTML semantics, I was able to streamline the HTML and CSS for this webpage.

* Spaced out html lines to make more legible.

* Replaced multiple classes and div tags with, header, nav, figure, article, section, aside, and footer tags. This will help with Search engine optimization.

Furthermore, I applied small changes to clean up image tags and make a more user friendly experience for the visually impaired by add an alternate description

* Added alt tags to all images, briefly describing the picture.

* Cleaned up closing tags for images. 

* I removed the class footer and simply replaced the html tag with footer.
