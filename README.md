# Homework_1

In this project I spent most of my time cleaning up the CSS style sheet. Changes made are as followed:

HTML changes:

Spaced out html lines to make more legible.

Added alt tags to all images, briefly describing the picture.

Cleaned up closing tags for images. 


CSS changes:

Color change to text in header. Changed color to highlight SEO.

I moved .footer and .footer h2 above all the consolidated lines.


Some selectors had the same properties so those selectors were consolidated. Below you can see which selectors were consolidated:

Consolidated benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost 

Consolidated benefit-lead h3, benefit-brand h3, and benefit-cost h3

Consolidated benefit-lead img, benefit-brand img, and benefit-cost img

Consolidated Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing 

Consolidated Search Engine Optimization img, Online Reputation Management img, and Social Media Marketing img 

Consolidated Search Engine Optimization h2, Online Reputation Management h2, and Social Media Marketing  h2
